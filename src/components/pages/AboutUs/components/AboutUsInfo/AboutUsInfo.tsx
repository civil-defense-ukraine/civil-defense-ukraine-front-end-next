            My name is Anna Gabedov, and together with my father, Jurij Gabedov,
            we have created Civil Defense Ukraine. <br />
            <br />
            Civil Defense Ukraine is a charitable organization founded in
            February-March 2022, when the war began. Our mission is to assist
            civilians in Ukraine who took up arms to defend the country. That's
            why we are called Civil Defense. <br /> We now live in Denmark, but
            we are Ukrainians, dedicating our free time to support the people of
            our native country.

            What We Do?
          </h2>
          <p className={styles.article__text}>
            This war has struck a personal chord. Our friends and relatives are
            actively fighting, have been forced to flee their homes, and are
            traumatized for life. These are innocent people, with ordinary jobs
            and ordinary lives, who “merely” want the freedom, which we take for
            granted in the West. Instead, they are faced with the brutal
            reality, fighting for Ukraine's existence.
            <br />
            Early on in the war, we were made aware of the fact that people we
            know, who have volunteered for the Territorial Defense Unit, have no
            protection gear, no helmets, and no bulletproof vests. They lack
            night vision gear to be able to see, during the tough fights at
            night, and they lack walkie-talkies to communicate with one another.{' '}
            <br /> <br /> So, my father and I started buying military protective
            equipment, and we have now dedicated the last years to doing so...

            Our Mission
          </h2>
          <p className={styles.article__text}>
            Our mission is to provide our soldiers with everything they need for
            their difficult but justified work. We also seek to support our
            compatriots who have lost their homes or are suffering from this
            terrible war.
            <br /> We believe that the fate of not only the whole of Europe, but
            also peace in the whole world, depends on whether Ukraine stands up.
            We hope, that we have inspired you to help Ukrainian`s fight for
            freedom. Together, we are able to accelerate Ukraine`s victory. We
            must not give up. We must continue to support our freedom fighters.
